  <div class="about">
    <p>  Hi I’m Bram, in 2015 I graduated from Rutgers University with a Bachelors in 
                Human Resources and Labor studies. I was privileged to have met and collaborated 
                with exceptionally talented individuals in classes that helped me develop event 
                coordination and networking skills. If you would like to know more please add me 
                to your professional network, I’d love to start a conversation!</p>
