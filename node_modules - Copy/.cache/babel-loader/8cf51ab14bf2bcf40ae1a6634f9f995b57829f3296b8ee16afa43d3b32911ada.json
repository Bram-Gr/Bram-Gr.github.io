I was privileged to have met and collaborated \r\n                with exceptionally talented individuals in classes that helped me develop event \r\n                coordination and networking skills. If you would like to know more please add me \r\n                to your professional network, I’d love to start a conversation!\r\n             </p>   \r\n   \r\n          <p class=\"p2\">\r\n                Make it happen, but where do I start? This is a question I’ve asked myself time and time again throughout my academic and professional development. When staring at a “blank canvas” whether it be an empty book of business, a strategy for coordinating professional events, or an empty method in Java, I’ve found that getting started is typically the most difficult step. Throughout my career I’ve also realized getting over that hurdle gets more appealing with each accomplishment. \r\n\r\n                After graduating college I earned my real estate license and am currently in a software development bootcamp at Tech Elevator. In every role I’ve held there’s always an unknown which leads to discovery and development of new skills. I look forward to directing that focus in a career in technology.\r\n            </p>\r\n          \r\n            <div class=\"student-picture\">\r\n            <img :src=\"profileImage\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"370px\" height=\"450px\">\r\n        </div>\r\n       \r\n        \r\n\r\n     \r\n            <p class=\"contact\">\r\n               \r\n                BramZachGroen@gmail.com<br/>\r\n                609-703-6051\r\n            </p>\r\n      \r\n        </div>\r\n      \r\n\r\n        <div id=\"experience-grid\">\r\n            <div id=\"experience-code\">\r\n                <h3><i class=\"fa fa-code\"></i> code</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Spring Boot, Java, Vue.js, Responsive Design, IntelliJ, Git, Unit Testing (JUnit), Integration Testing\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div id=\"experience-database\">\r\n                <h3><i class=\"fa fa-database\"></i>database</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    PostgreSQL\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div id=\"experience-web\">\r\n                <h3><i class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"></i>web</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div id=\"experience-design\">\r\n               <h3><i class=\"fa fa-paint-brush\"></i> design</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    E/R diagrams\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>   \r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nimport profileImage from '@/assets/Subject.png'\r\nexport default {\r\ndata(){\r\n    return {\r\n        profileImage: profileImage\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n\r\np{\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n}\r\n.p1{\r\n     margin-top: ;\r\n    grid-area: p1;\r\n\r\n}\r\n.p2{\r\n   \r\n grid-area: p2;\r\n}\r\n.student-picture{\r\n  grid-area: pic;\r\n}\r\n.contact{\r\n grid-area:contact;\r\n}\r\n.top-page{\r\n    margin-top:6rem;\r\n    display: grid;\r\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;\r\n  grid-template-rows: auto;\r\n  grid-template-areas:\r\n    \"p1 p1 pic\"\r\n    \"p2 p2 pic\"\r\n    \". . contact\";\r\n}\r\n    \r\n</style>"],"mappings":"AAkEA,OAAAA,YAAA;AACA;EACAC,KAAA;IACA;MACAD,YAAA,EAAAA;IACA;EACA;AAEA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
